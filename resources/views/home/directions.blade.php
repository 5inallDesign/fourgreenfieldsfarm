<h1>Driving Directions</h1>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Don't use 15693 Wilson Road as your destination when using GPS or an internet driving directions site. <strong>Use 16600 160th Avenue, Rodney, MI 49342.</strong>  We are &quot;off the grid&quot; just a little so our real address doesn't show up. The 160th Avenue address will put you right at the entrance to the farm and you just follow the signs from there.</p>
